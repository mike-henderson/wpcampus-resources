# Managing WPCampus Resources

This repository manages the content for [the Resources section on the main WPCampus website](https://wpcampus.org/resources/).

The WPCampus community wanted to create an accessible and easy to maintain knowledge base for fellow WordPress users in higher education. We hope it's beneficial to you and your campus and that you'll consider "forwarding it on" by contributing your own knowledge and resources.

## To contribute

This repository uses [wpcampus-wp-github-sync](https://github.com/wpcampus/wpcampus-wp-github-sync) to sync the resources post content in the [wpcampus.org](https://wpcampus.org/) WordPress admin as files in the repo. You can add and edit [WPCampus Resources](https://wpcampus.org/resources/) by submitting changes to this repo.

**In order to add or edit the resources section of wpcampus.org, please submit a pull request to this repo.** Once approved, it will be merged to the repository and automatically published on the website.
