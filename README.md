# Managing WPCampus Resources

This repository manages the content for [the Resources section on the main WPCampus website](https://wpcampus.org/resources/).

The WPCampus community wanted to create an accessible and easy to maintain knowledge base for fellow WordPress users in higher education. We hope it's beneficial to you and your campus and that you'll consider "forwarding it on" by contributing your own knowledge and resources.

## Want to request a resource?

We will monitor resource requests and questions in [the Issues section of the repo](https://github.com/wpcampus/wpcampus-resources/issues).

First, check the issues to see if your request has already been submitted. If not, create an issue and we will do our best to gather some information. If you have some resources you'd like to share, consider contributing to the repo.

## To contribute

This repository uses [wpcampus-wp-github-sync](https://github.com/wpcampus/wpcampus-wp-github-sync) to sync the resources post content in the [wpcampus.org](https://wpcampus.org/) WordPress admin as files in the repo. You can add and edit [WPCampus Resources](https://wpcampus.org/resources/) by submitting changes to this repo.
